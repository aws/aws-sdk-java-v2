The **AWS SDK for Java 2.0** is a rewrite of 1.0 with some great new features. As with version 1.0,
it enables you to easily work with [Amazon Web Services][aws] but also includes features like
non-blocking IO and pluggable HTTP implementation to further customize your applications. You can
get started in minutes using ***Maven*** or any build system that supports MavenCentral as an
artifact source.

## Getting Started

#### Sign up for AWS ####

Before you begin, you need an AWS account. Please see the [Sign Up for AWS][docs-signup] section of
the developer guide for information about how to create an AWS account and retrieve your AWS
credentials.

#### Minimum requirements ####

To run the SDK you will need **Java 1.8+**. For more information about the requirements and optimum
settings for the SDK, please see the [Installing a Java Development Environment][docs-java-env]
section of the developer guide.

## Using the SDK

The recommended way to use the AWS SDK for Java in your project is to consume it from Maven. 

#### Importing the BOM ####

To automatically manage module versions (currently all modules have the same version, but this may not always be the case) we recommend you use the [Bill of Materials][bom] import as follows:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
      <artifactId>bom</artifactId>
      <version>2.11.7</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Then individual models may omit the `version` from their dependency statement:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>ec2</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>s3</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>dynamodb</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
#### Individual Services ####

Alternatively you can add dependencies for the specific services you use only:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>ec2</artifactId>
  <version>2.11.7</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>s3</artifactId>
  <version>2.11.7</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Whole SDK ####

You can import the whole SDK into your project (includes *ALL* services). Please note that it is recommended to only import the modules you need.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>aws-sdk-java</artifactId>
  <version>2.11.7</version>
</dependency>
```

See the [Set up the AWS SDK for Java][docs-setup] section of the developer guide for more usage information.

## New Features for 2.0

* Provides a way to plug in your own HTTP implementation.

* Provides first class support for non-blocking IO in Async clients.

## Building From Source

Once you check out the code from GitHub, you can build it using Maven.

```sh
mvn clean install

# Skip tests, checkstyles, findbugs, etc for quick build
mvn clean install -P quick

# Build a specific service module
mvn clean install -pl :s3 -P quick --am
```

## Sample Code
You can find sample code for v2 in the following places:

* [aws-doc-sdk-examples] repo.
* Integration tests in this repo. They are located in the `it` directory under each service module, eg: [s3-integration-tests]
