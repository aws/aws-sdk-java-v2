/**
 * Marshaller interface for storing complex types in DynamoDB as Strings.
 * Implementors provide methods to transform instances of a class to and from
 * Strings.
 *
 * @deprecated Replaced by {@link DynamoDbTypeConverter}
 *
 * <p>A {@link DynamoDbTypeConverted} with {@link String} as source would
 * perform the same conversion. Please consider, if your marshaller is thread
 * safe before replacing. In the new implementation, a single instance of
 * {@link DynamoDbTypeConverted} is created per field/attribute. In the old,
 * an new instance of the marshaller was created for each call to
 * {@code marshall} and {@code unmarshall}. If your marshaller/converter is not
 * thread safe, it is recommended to specify a converter which will instantiate
 * a new marshaller per call.</p>
