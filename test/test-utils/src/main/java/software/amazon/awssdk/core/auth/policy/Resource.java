     * Constructs a new AWS access control policy resource. Resources are

     * <p>
     * You specify the resource using the following Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
     * format:
     * <b>{@code arn:aws:<vendor>:<region>:<namespace>:<relative-id>}</b>
     * <p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>vendor identifies the AWS product (e.g., sns)</li>
     * <li>region is the AWS Region the resource resides in (e.g., us-east-1),
     * if any
     * <li>namespace is the AWS account ID with no hyphens (e.g., 123456789012)
     * <li>relative-id is the service specific portion that identifies the
     * specific resource
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * For example, an Amazon SQS queue might be addressed with the following
     * ARN: <b>arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:987654321000:MyQueue</b>
     * <p>
     * Some resources may not use every field in an ARN. For example, resources
     * in Amazon S3 are global, so they omit the region field:
     * <b>arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*</b>
