/**
 * AWS access control policy conditions are contained in {@link Statement}
 * objects, and affect when a statement is applied. For example, a statement
 * that allows access to an Amazon SQS queue could use a condition to only apply
 * the effect of that statement for requests that are made before a certain
 * date, or that originate from a range of IP addresses.
 * <p>
 * Multiple conditions can be included in a single statement, and all conditions
 * must evaluate to true in order for the statement to take effect.
 * <p>
 * The set of conditions is D in the statement
 * "A has permission to do B to C where D applies."
 * <p>
 * A condition is composed of three parts:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Condition Key</b> - The condition key declares which value of a
 * request to pull in and compare against when a policy is evaluated by AWS. For
 * example, using {@link software.amazon.awssdk.core.auth.policy.conditions.ConditionFactory#SOURCE_IP_CONDITION_KEY} will cause
 * AWS to pull in the current request's source IP as the first value to compare
 * against every time your policy is evaluated.
 * <li><b>Comparison Type</b> - Most condition types allow several ways to
 * compare the value obtained from the condition key and the comparison value.
 * <li><b>Comparison Value</b> - This is a static value used as the second value
 * in the comparison when your policy is evaluated. Depending on the comparison
 * type, this value can optionally use wildcards. See the documentation for
 * individual comparison types for more information.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are many expressive conditions available in the
 * <code>software.amazon.awssdk.core.auth.policy.conditions</code> package to use in access
 * control policy statements.
 * <p>
 * This class is not intended to be directly subclassed by users, instead users
 * should use the many available conditions and condition factories in the
 * software.amazon.awssdk.core.auth.policy.conditions package.
