/**
 * Customization to allow generation of additional setter overloads for a 'convenience' type (i.e. a
 * different type then what the member actually is but a more convenient representation to work
 * with, I.E. String rather than SdkBytes). Customization is configured with an adapter that knows
 * how to convert the 'convenience' type to the actual member type
 * <p>
 * Note - This customization is not directly exposed through {@link CustomizationConfig} at the
 * moment. Instead several pre-canned customizations use this under the hood but expose limited
 * functionality for overloading setters. This decision was made to discourage use of overloaded
 * types and instead model the member in a more natural way to begin with. In the future we may
 * either decide to fully expose this customization or just add more pre-canned settings as the need
 * arises
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Currently this does not support overloads for List or Map types but it could be easily
 * implemented in the Generator.
