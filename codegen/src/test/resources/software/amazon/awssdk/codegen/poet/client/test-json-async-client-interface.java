     * operation. The return type is a custom publisher that can be subscribed to request a stream of response pages.

     * failures only after you start streaming the data. The subscribe method should be called as a request to start
     * streaming data. For more info, see
     * {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher#subscribe(org.reactivestreams.Subscriber)}. Each call to the subscribe
     * method will result in a new {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscription} i.e., a new contract to stream data from the
     * starting request.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The following are few ways to use the response class:
     * </p>
     * 1) Using the forEach helper method
     *
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.paginators.PaginatedOperationWithResultKeyPublisher publisher = client.paginatedOperationWithResultKeyPaginator(request);
     * CompletableFuture<Void> future = publisher.forEach(res -> { // Do something with the response });
     * future.get();
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * 2) Using a custom subscriber
     *
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.paginators.PaginatedOperationWithResultKeyPublisher publisher = client.paginatedOperationWithResultKeyPaginator(request);
     * publisher.subscribe(new Subscriber<software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.model.PaginatedOperationWithResultKeyResponse>() {
     *
     * public void onSubscribe(org.reactivestreams.Subscriber subscription) { //... };

     *
     * public void onNext(software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.model.PaginatedOperationWithResultKeyResponse response) { //... };
     * });}
     * </pre>
     *
     * As the response is a publisher, it can work well with third party reactive streams implementations like RxJava2.
     * <p>
     * <b>Note: If you prefer to have control on service calls, use the
     * {@link #paginatedOperationWithResultKey(software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.model.PaginatedOperationWithResultKeyRequest)}
