    /**
     * Some paginated operation without result_key in paginators.json file<br/>
     * <p>
     * This is a variant of
     * {@link #paginatedOperationWithoutResultKey(software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.model.PaginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyRequest)}
     * operation. The return type is a custom iterable that can be used to iterate through all the pages. SDK will
     * internally handle making service calls for you.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When this operation is called, a custom iterable is returned but no service calls are made yet. So there is no
     * guarantee that the request is valid. As you iterate through the iterable, SDK will start lazily loading response
     * pages by making service calls until there are no pages left or your iteration stops. If there are errors in your
     * request, you will see the failures only after you start iterating through the iterable.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The following are few ways to iterate through the response pages:
     * </p>
     * 1) Using a Stream
     *
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.paginators.PaginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyIterable responses = client.paginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyPaginator(request);
     * responses.stream().forEach(....);
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * 2) Using For loop
     *
     * <pre>
     * {
     *     &#064;code
     *     software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.paginators.PaginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyIterable responses = client
     *             .paginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyPaginator(request);
     *     for (software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.model.PaginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyResponse response : responses) {
     *         // do something;
     *     }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * 3) Use iterator directly
     *
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.paginators.PaginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyIterable responses = client.paginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyPaginator(request);
     * responses.iterator().forEachRemaining(....);
     * }
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * <b>Please notice that the configuration of MaxResults won't limit the number of results you get with the
     * paginator. It only limits the number of results in each page.</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Note: If you prefer to have control on service calls, use the
     * {@link #paginatedOperationWithoutResultKey(software.amazon.awssdk.services.json.model.PaginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyRequest)}
     * operation.</b>
     * </p>
     *
     * @param paginatedOperationWithoutResultKeyRequest
     * @return A custom iterable that can be used to iterate through all the response pages.
