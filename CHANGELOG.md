## __AWS SDK for Java v2__
  - ### Features
    - This release updates internal logic for constructing API endpoints. 

      We have added rule-based endpoint providers. Additionally there are new interfaces for endpoint providers and parameters at the service client level.

      The SDK provides service-specific `EndpointProvider` interfaces (e.g. `S3EndpointProvider`), that have a single method `resolveEndpoint`. `resolveEndpoint` accepts a set of parameters (also service specific) and computes an endpoint based on those parameters. All clients have a default implementation, but users are free to implement these to customize their endpoint logic.

      It is important to know that `EndpointProvider`s and the endpoint override on the client are not mutually exclusive. In all existing cases, the endpoint override is passed as a parameter to the the provider and the provider *may* modify it. For example, the S3 provider may add the bucket name as a prefix to the endpoint override for virtual bucket addressing.

      There may be some behavior changes related to endpoint resolution as as the the endpoint resolution is now standardised across SDKs so this release also bumps the minor version of the SDK to `2.18`.

      Notably, there are some changes in S3: when including and endpoint override, the SDK will use virtual bucket addressing as long as the bucket is a valid DNS label. This is different from the previous behavior where this only happens if the endpoint override begins with 's3'.

      In many situations, the exception thrown for validations like including an endpoint override and enabling DualStack has changed to `SdkClientExcpetion` and error messages have changed as well.

# __2.17.23__ __2021-08-19__
## __AWS SDK for Java v2__
  - ### Features
    - Implement ADAPTIVE retry mode. ADAPTIVE mode builds on STANDARD retry mode and adds rate limiting of requests when the client is throttled.

      Adaptive retry mode dynamically limits the rate of AWS requests to maximize success rate. This may be at the expense of request latency. Adaptive retry mode is not recommended when predictable latency is important.

      Warning: Adaptive retry mode assumes that the client is working against a single resource (e.g. one DynamoDB Table or one S3 Bucket). If you use a single client for multiple resources, throttling or outages associated with one resource will result in increased latency and failures when accessing all other resources via the same client. When using adaptive retry mode, we recommend using a single client per resource.

The order in which header values are inspected is: headers set by the request marshaller, overridden headers set on the client, then finally overridden headers set on the SDK request object.

    - This release adds support for the Amazon Resource Groups Tagging API to Amazon Pinpoint, which means that you can now add and manage tags for Amazon Pinpoint projects (apps), campaigns, and segments. A tag is a label that you optionally define and associate with Amazon Pinpoint resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage these types of resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. For example, you can use tags to apply policies or automation, or to identify resources that are subject to certain compliance requirements. A project, campaign, or segment can have as many as 50 tags. For more information about using and managing tags in Amazon Pinpoint, see the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html. For more information about the Amazon Resource Group Tagging API, see the Amazon Resource Group Tagging API Reference at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html.

    - Added convenience methods for both sync and async streaming operations for file based uploads/downloads.
    - Added some convenience implementation of [AsyncResponseHandler](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/async/AsyncResponseHandler.java) to emit to a byte array or String.
    - Immutable objects can now be modified easily with a newly introduced [copy](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/utils/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/utils/builder/ToCopyableBuilder.java#L42) method that applies a transformation on the builder for the object and returns a new immutable object.
    - Major refactor of RequestHandler interfaces. Newly introduced [ExecutionInterceptors](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/interceptor/ExecutionInterceptor.java) have a cleaner, more consistent API and are much more powerful.
    - S3's CreateBucket no longer requires the location constraint to be specified, it will be inferred from the client region if not present.
    - The [File](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/sync/StreamingResponseHandler.java#L92) and [OutputStream](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/sync/StreamingResponseHandler.java#L107) implementations of StreamingResponseHandler now return the POJO response in onComplete.

  - ### Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug in default credential provider chain where it would erroneously abort at the ProfileCredentialsProvider. See [Issue #135](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/135)
    - Many improvements and fixes to the Netty NIO based transport.
    - Several fixes around S3's endpoint resolution, particularly with advanced options like path style addressing and accelerate mode. See [Issue #130](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/130)
    - Several fixes around serialization and deserialization of immutable objects. See [Issue #122](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/122)
    - Type parameters are now correctly included for [StreamingResponseHandler](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/sync/StreamingResponseHandler.java) on the client interface.

  - ### Removals
    - Dependency on JodaTime has been dropped in favor of Java 8's APIS.
    - DynamoDBMapper and DynamoDB Document API have been removed.
    - Metrics subsystem has been removed.

# __2.0.0-preview-2__ __2017-07-21__
## __AWS SDK for Java v2__
  - ### Features
    - New pluggable HTTP implementation built on top of Java's HttpUrlConnection. Good choice for simple applications with low throughput requirements. Better cold start latency than the default Apache implementation.
    - Simple convenience methods have been added for operations that require no input parameters.
    - Substantial improvements to start up time and cold start latencies
    - The Netty NIO HTTP client now uses a shared event loop group for better resource management. More options for customizing the event loop group are now available.
    - Using java.time instead of the legacy java.util.Date in generated model classes.
    - Various improvements to the immutability of model POJOs. ByteBuffers are now copied and collections are returned as unmodifiable.

# __2.0.0-preview-1__ __2017-06-28__
## __AWS SDK for Java v2__
  - ### Features
    - Initial release of the AWS SDK for Java v2. See our [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-sdk-for-java-2-0-developer-preview) for information about this new major version. This release is considered a developer preview and is not intended for production use cases.
