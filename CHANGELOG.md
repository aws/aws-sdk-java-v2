# __2.26.0__ __2024-06-11__
## __"AWS SDK for Java v2"__
  - ### Features
    - This release contains a major internal refactor of retries and is part
      of moving the SDK to a standardized AWS SDK architecture. It
      introduces the interface `RetryStrategy` and three subclasses
      `StandardRetryStrategy`, `LegacyRetryStrategy` , and
      `AdaptiveRetryStrategy`. The new interfaces live in the `retry-spi`
      module, and the implementation classes live in the `retries` module.

      Note 1) This change marks RetryPolicy as as deprecated and we
      encourage users to migrate to its replacement, RetryStrategy. However,
      retry policies are, and will for the foreseeable future be fully
      supported. Clients configured to use retry policies will not need any
      code changes and wonâ€™t see any behavioral change with this release.

      Note 2) The original implementation of adaptive mode (see
      [#2658](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/2658)) that was
      released with the retry policy API contains a bug in its rate-limiter
      logic which prevents it from remembering state across requests. In
      this release of the retry strategy API, we introduce
      `RetryMode.ADAPTIVE_V2`, which implements the correct adaptive
      behavior. `RetryMode.ADAPTIVE` is still present in order to maintain
      backwards compatibility, but is now marked as deprecated.

      Note 3) When configuring retry mode through system settings or
      environment variables, users can only choose adaptive mode. This
      setting will map to `RetryMode.ADAPTIVE_V2` instead of
      `RetryMode.ADAPTIVE` with this release, giving users the correct
      behavior and still keeping the settings consistent across all
      SDKs. The list of configuration options are: profile file `retry_mode`
      setting, the `aws.retryMode` system property and the `AWS_RETRY_MODE`
      environment variable.
