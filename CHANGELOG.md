# __2.0.0-preview-11__ __2018-07-30__
## __AWS SDK for Java v2__
  - ### Features
    - Accept `SdkBytes` and `byte[]` instead of `ByteBuffer` in generated setters.
    - Add support to disable EC2 instance metadata service usage via environment variable and system property. [#430](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/430)
    - Caching `XPathFactory` to improve performance of exception handling for services using XML protocol
    - Exceptions use builders and are immutable.
    - Incorporate the [Reactive Streams Technology Compatibility Kit](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/tree/master/tck) and ensure current implementations are compliant. [#519](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/519)
    - Modules (annotations, auth, sdk-core, aws-core, profiles, regions) are refactored under the core module.
    - Refactor signer interfaces to be independent from Amazon/AWS specific classes. Signer interfaces expose a sign method that takes in the request to sign and ExecutionAttributes instance. Parameters needed for signing are to be passed through ExecutionAttributes. SDK signer implementations have overloaded sign methods that can take either generic ExecutionAttributes or modeled params classes as convenience for customers.
    - Region class clean up including the following: - Flattened GovCloud - Renamed `Region.value()` to `Region.id()` - Dropped `get` prefix in the method names. eg: `getRegions()` -> `regions()`
    - Renamed all non-service enums to be singular, not plural.
    - Renaming `SdkBuilder.apply()` -> `SdkBuilder.applyMutation()` and renaming `ResponseTransformer.apply()` to `ResponseTransformer.transform()`.
    - Return `SdkBytes` instead of `ByteBuffer` from generated getters.
    - Update all service models to follow V2 naming convention. eg: `WAFException` -> `WafException`
    - Update service name in clients, requests and exceptions to match 2.0 naming conventions (eg. DynamoDBClient -> DynamoDbClient)
    - Updated `AwsCredentials` to interface implemented by `AwsBasicCredentials` and `AwsSessionCredentials`. Renamed `AwsCredentialsProvider.getCredentials()` to `AwsCredentialsProvider.resolveCredentials()`.
    - Use auto constructed containers for list and map members. [#497](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/497), [#529](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/529), [#600](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/600)
    - Various AsyncClient Refactors:\n - Drop async prefix in `SdkAyncClientBuilder`: `SdkAsyncClientBuilder.asyncHttpClientBuilder() -> SdkAsyncClientBuilder.httpClientBuilder()`\n - Create `SdkEventLoopGroup` to allow users to provide `EventLoopGroup` and `ChannelFactory`.
    - upgrade Netty 4.1.22.Final to Netty 4.1.26.Final

## __AWS SDK for Java v2__
  - ### Features
    - Added convenience methods for both sync and async streaming operations for file based uploads/downloads.
    - Added some convenience implementation of [AsyncResponseHandler](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/async/AsyncResponseHandler.java) to emit to a byte array or String.
    - Immutable objects can now be modified easily with a newly introduced [copy](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/utils/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/utils/builder/ToCopyableBuilder.java#L42) method that applies a transformation on the builder for the object and returns a new immutable object.
    - Major refactor of RequestHandler interfaces. Newly introduced [ExecutionInterceptors](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/interceptor/ExecutionInterceptor.java) have a cleaner, more consistent API and are much more powerful.
    - S3's CreateBucket no longer requires the location constraint to be specified, it will be inferred from the client region if not present.
    - The [File](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/sync/StreamingResponseHandler.java#L92) and [OutputStream](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/sync/StreamingResponseHandler.java#L107) implementations of StreamingResponseHandler now return the POJO response in onComplete.

    - Several fixes around S3's endpoint resolution, particularly with advanced options like path style addressing and accelerate mode. See [Issue #130](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/130)
    - Several fixes around serialization and deserialization of immutable objects. See [Issue #122](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/122)
    - Type parameters are now correctly included for [StreamingResponseHandler](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/sync/StreamingResponseHandler.java) on the client interface.

    - Simple convenience methods have been added for operations that require no input parameters.
    - Substantial improvments to start up time and cold start latencies
    - The Netty NIO HTTP client now uses a shared event loop group for better resource management. More options for customizing the event loop group are now available.
    - Using java.time instead of the legacy java.util.Date in generated model classes.
    - Various improvements to the immutability of model POJOs. ByteBuffers are now copied and collections are returned as unmodifiable.
