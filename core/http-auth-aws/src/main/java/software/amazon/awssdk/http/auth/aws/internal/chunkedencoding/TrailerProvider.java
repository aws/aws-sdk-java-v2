/**
 * A functional interface for defining a trailer, where the trailer is a header pair.
 * <p>
 * A trailer usually depends on the chunk-data itself (checksum, signature, etc.), but is not required to.
 * Per <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.2">RFC-7230</a>, the chunked trailer
 * section is defined as:
 * <pre>
 *     trailer-part   = *( header-field CRLF )
 * </pre>
 * An implementation of this interface is specifically an element of the {@code trailer-part}. Therefore, all occurrences of
 * {@code TrailerProvider}'s make up the {@code trailer-part}.
