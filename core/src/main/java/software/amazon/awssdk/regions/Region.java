/**
 * An Amazon Web Services region that hosts a set of Amazon services.
 *
 * <p>An instance of this class can be retrieved by referencing one of the static constants defined in this class
 * (eg. {@link Region#US_EAST_1}) or by using the {@link Region#of(String)} method if the region you want is not
 * included in this release of the SDK.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each AWS region corresponds to a separate geographical location where a set of Amazon services is deployed. These regions
 * (except for the special {@link #AWS_GLOBAL} and {@link #AWS_CN_GLOBAL} regions) are separate from each other, with their own
 * set of resources. This means a resource created in one region (eg. an SQS queue) is not available in another region.</p>
 *
 * <p>To programmatically determine whether a particular service is deployed to a region, you can use the {@code serviceMetadata}
 * method on the service's client interface. Additional metadata about a region can be discovered using
 * {@link RegionMetadata#of(Region)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Region#value()} will be used as the signing region for all requests to AWS services unless an explicit region
 * override is available in {@link RegionMetadata}. This value will also be used to construct the endpoint for accessing a
 * service unless an explicit endpoint is available for that region in {@link RegionMetadata}.</p>
