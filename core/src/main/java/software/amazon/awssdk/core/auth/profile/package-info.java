/**
 * AWS configuration profiles allow you to share multiple sets of AWS
 * security credentials between different tools such as the AWS SDK for Java
 * and the AWS CLI.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the required <code>default</code> profile, you can specify as
 * many additional named profiles as you need:
 * <pre>
 * [default]
 * aws_access_key_id=AKIAXXXXXXXXXX
 * aws_secret_access_key=abc01234567890
 *
 * [profile test]
 * aws_access_key_id=AKIAZZZZZZZZZZ
 * aws_secret_access_key=xyz01234567890
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Role assumption is also supported for cross account access. The source profile credentials are
 * used to assume the given role when the <pre>test</pre> profile is used. One requirement to use
 * assume role profiles is that the STS SDK module be on the class path.
 * <pre>
 * [default]
 * aws_access_key_id=AKIAXXXXXXXXXX
 * aws_secret_access_key=abc01234567890
 *
 * [profile test]
 * role_arn=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role-name
 * source_profile=default
 * # Optionally, provide a session name
 * # role_session_name=mysession
 * # Optionally, provide an external id
 * # external_id=abc01234567890
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * You can use {@link software.amazon.awssdk.core.auth.ProfileCredentialsProvider} to
 * access your AWS configuration profiles and supply your credentials to code
 * using the AWS SDK for Java.
 *
 * <p>
 * The same profiles are used by the AWS CLI.
 *
 * <p>
 * For more information on setting up AWS configuration profiles, see:
