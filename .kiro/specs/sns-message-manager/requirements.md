# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SnsMessageManager feature provides automatic validation of SNS message signatures in AWS SDK for Java v2. This feature was available in Java SDK v1 but is currently missing in v2, creating a gap for developers who need to verify the authenticity and integrity of SNS messages received via HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. The feature ensures that messages sent to customer HTTP endpoints are genuinely from Amazon SNS and have not been tampered with during transmission.

This feature addresses the community request tracked in [GitHub Issue #1302](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/1302) and implements the signature verification process documented in the [AWS SNS Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-verify-signature-of-message.html).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Java developer using AWS SDK v2 with HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, I want to validate SNS message signatures automatically, so that I can ensure the authenticity and integrity of messages sent to my HTTP endpoints from SNS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides an SNS message payload THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the message signature using AWS cryptographic verification
2. WHEN the message signature is valid THEN the system SHALL return a parsed SNS message object with all message attributes
3. WHEN the message signature is invalid THEN the system SHALL throw a clear exception indicating signature validation failure
4. WHEN the message format is malformed OR contains unexpected fields THEN the system SHALL reject the message with an appropriate parsing exception
5. WHEN validating signatures THEN the system SHALL support both SignatureVersion1 (SHA1) and SignatureVersion2 (SHA256) as per AWS SNS standards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer receiving SNS messages at HTTP/HTTPS endpoints from multiple AWS regions and partitions, I want automatic certificate management for signature validation, so that I can securely process notifications from regional SNS topics without manual certificate configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving signing certificates THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS only to prevent unauthorized interception attacks
2. WHEN validating certificates THEN the system SHALL verify that certificates are issued by Amazon SNS and have a valid chain of trust
3. WHEN processing certificate URLs THEN the system SHALL validate that URLs come from SNS-signed domains and reject untrusted sources
4. WHEN a message contains an invalid or unknown certificate URL THEN the system SHALL reject the message with a security exception
5. WHEN validating messages from different AWS partitions THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate partition-specific certificate endpoints
6. WHEN processing certificates THEN the system SHALL never trust certificates provided directly in messages without proper validation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer migrating from AWS SDK v1 to v2, I want the same core functionalities as the v1 SnsMessageManager, so that I can achieve equivalent SNS message validation capabilities in v2.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing SNS messages THEN the system SHALL provide message signature validation equivalent to v1 functionality
2. WHEN accessing parsed message content THEN the system SHALL provide access to all standard SNS message fields (Type, MessageId, TopicArn, Subject, Message, Timestamp, etc.)
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error reporting similar to v1 behavior
4. WHEN processing different SNS message types THEN the system SHALL handle Notification, SubscriptionConfirmation, and UnsubscribeConfirmation messages like v1
