/**
 * A synchronous client for interacting with DynamoDB.
 *
 * <p>
 * This enhanced DynamoDB client replaces the generated {@link DynamoDbClient} with one that is easier for a Java customer to
 * use. It does this by converting between Java built-in types (eg. java.time.Instant) and DynamoDB attribute value types.
 *
 * <p>
 * This can be created using the static {@link #builder()} or {@link #create()} methods. The client must be {@link #close()}d
 * when it is done being used.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code DynamoDbEnhancedClient} is thread-safe and relatively expensive to create. It's strongly advised to create a single
 * {@code DynamoDbEnhancedClient} instance that is reused throughout your whole application.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example Usage:
 * <code>
 * // Create a client to use for this example, and then close it. Usually, one client would be used throughout an application.
 * try (DynamoDbEnhancedClient client = DynamoDbEnhancedClient.create()) {
 *     Table booksTable = client.table("books");
 *     ResponseItem book = booksTable.getItem(...);
 * }
 * </code>
