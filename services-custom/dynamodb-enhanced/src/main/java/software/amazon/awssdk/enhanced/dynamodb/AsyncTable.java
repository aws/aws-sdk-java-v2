/**
 * An asynchronous way of interacting with a DynamoDB table. This is usually created via
 * {@link DynamoDbEnhancedAsyncClient#table(String)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This provides facilities for writing {@link RequestItem}s to a table and reading {@link ResponseItem}s from a table. All
 * operations are non-blocking, returning a {@link CompletableFuture} for the result, instead of the result itself.
 *
 * <p>
 * Supported operations:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link #getItem(RequestItem)} to retrieve a single item from the table.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #putItem(RequestItem)} to write a single item to a table.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * This {@link AsyncTable} will throw exceptions from all operations if the {@link DynamoDbEnhancedAsyncClient} that was used to
 * create it is closed.
