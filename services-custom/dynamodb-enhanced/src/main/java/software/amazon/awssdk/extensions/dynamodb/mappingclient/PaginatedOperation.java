/**
 * Common interface for an operation that can be executed in a synchronous or non-blocking asynchronous fashion
 * against a mapped database table and is expected to return a paginated list of results. These operations can be made
 * against either the primary index of a table or a secondary index, although some implementations of this interface
 * do not support secondary indices and will throw an exception when executed against one. Typically, each page of
 * results that is served will automatically perform an additional service call to DynamoDb to retrieve the next set
 * of results.
 * <p>
 * This interface is extended by {@link PaginatedTableOperation} and {@link PaginatedIndexOperation} which contain
 * implementations of the behavior to actually execute the operation in the context of a table or secondary index and
 * are used by {@link DynamoDbTable} or {@link DynamoDbAsyncTable} and {@link DynamoDbIndex} or {@link DynamoDbAsyncIndex}
 * respectively. By sharing this common interface operations are able to re-use code regardless of whether they are
 * executed in the context of a primary or secondary index or whether they are being executed in a synchronous or
 * non-blocking asynchronous fashion.
 *
 * @param <ItemT> The modelled object that this table maps records to.
 * @param <RequestT>  The type of the request object for the DynamoDb call in the low level {@link DynamoDbClient} or
 *                  {@link DynamoDbAsyncClient}.
 * @param <ResponseT> The type of the response object for the DynamoDb call in the low level {@link DynamoDbClient}
 *                  or {@link DynamoDbAsyncClient}.
 * @param <ResultT> The type of the mapped result object that will be returned by the execution of this operation.
