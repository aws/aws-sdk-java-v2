/**
 * The class to which this annotation is applied is thread-safe.  This means that
 * no sequences of accesses (reads and writes to public fields, calls to public methods)
 * may put the object into an invalid state, regardless of the interleaving of those actions
 * by the runtime, and without requiring any additional synchronization or coordination on the
 * part of the caller.
 * <p>
 * Based on code developed by Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls and concepts
 * published in 'Java Concurrency in Practice' by Brian Goetz, Tim Peierls,
 * Joshua Bloch, Joseph Bowbeer, David Holmes and Doug Lea.
