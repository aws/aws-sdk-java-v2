                {1} uses a method that is prohibited.
                The headers() and rawQueryParameters() methods create a deep copy of the data, which can result in
                significant memory pressure. Instead of retrieving a copy of the headers to look at it, use methods like
                hasHeaders(), firstMatchingHeader(...) or forEachHeader(..) which may be optimized in the type to avoid
                copying the data.
