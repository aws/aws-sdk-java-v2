                {1} uses a method that is prohibited.
                The headers() and rawQueryParameters() methods create a deep copy of the data, which can result in
                significant memory pressure. Instead of retrieving a copy of the headers to look at it, use methods like
                hasHeaders(), firstMatchingHeader(...) or forEachHeader(..) which may be optimized in the type to avoid
                copying the data.

        <LongDescription>Blocking call in async code path. See the SpotBugs logs for problem details</LongDescription>
        <Details>
            The SDK disallow the usage of blocking calls like CompletableFuture.join() or Thread.sleep() in the
            asynchronous code path. If this is a legitimate use of a blocking call outside of the async code path or
            a false positive, this error can be suppressed by updating the spotbugs-suppression.xml file located at
            build-tools/src/main/resources/software/amazon/awssdk/spotbugs-suppressions.xml
