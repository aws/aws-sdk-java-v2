This release refactors the S3TransferManager interface hierarchy and client API to differentiate between file-based and non-file-based transfers, allowing arbitrary object transfers. As a result, some S3TransferManager method signatures have changed in a backwards-incompatible way. Most notably, `Upload upload(UploadRequest)` becomes `FileUpload uploadFile(UploadFileRequest)`, and likewise for download variants. Please see https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/2817 for a full list of changes."
