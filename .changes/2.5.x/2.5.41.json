The Managed Policy ARNs can be passed via the PolicyArns parameter, which is now available in the AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and GetFederationToken APIs. The session policies referenced by the PolicyArn parameter will only further restrict the existing permissions of an IAM User or Role for individual sessions."
