These appliances can be deployed as individual instances, or as a fleet of instances behind a Network Load Balancer with a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) listener. Traffic Mirroring supports filters and packet truncation, so that you only extract the traffic of interest to monitor by using monitoring tools of your choice."
