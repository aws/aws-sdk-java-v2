AWS services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they have added to CloudFront. The status value is returned in the CloudFront response; you cannot configure it yourself. The status is set to APPROVED for all CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China."
