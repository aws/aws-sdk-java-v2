            "description": "This release contains a major internal refactor of retries and is part\nof moving the SDK to a standardized AWS SDK architecture. It\nintroduces the interface `RetryStrategy` and three subclasses\n`StandardRetryStrategy`, `LegacyRetryStrategy` , and\n`AdaptiveRetryStrategy`. The new interfaces live in the `retry-spi`\nmodule, and the implementation classes live in the `retries` module.\n\nNote 1) This change marks RetryPolicy as as deprecated and we\nencourage users to migrate to its replacement, RetryStrategy. However,\nretry policies are, and will for the foreseeable future be fully\nsupported. Clients configured to use retry policies will not need any\ncode changes and won\u2019t see any behavioral change with this release.\n\nNote 2) The original implementation of adaptive mode (see\n[#2658](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/2658)) that was\nreleased with the retry policy API contains a bug in its rate-limiter\nlogic which prevents it from remembering state across requests. In\nthis release of the retry strategy API, we introduce\n`RetryMode.ADAPTIVE_V2`, which implements the correct adaptive\nbehavior. `RetryMode.ADAPTIVE` is still present in order to maintain\nbackwards compatibility, but is now marked as deprecated.\n\nNote 3) When configuring retry mode through system settings or\nenvironment variables, users can only choose adaptive mode. This\nsetting will map to `RetryMode.ADAPTIVE_V2` instead of\n`RetryMode.ADAPTIVE` with this release, giving users the correct\nbehavior and still keeping the settings consistent across all\nSDKs. The list of configuration options are: profile file `retry_mode`\nsetting, the `aws.retryMode` system property and the `AWS_RETRY_MODE`\nenvironment variable."
