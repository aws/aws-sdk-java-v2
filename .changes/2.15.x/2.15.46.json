            "description": "Treat zero-byte responses from async HTTP clients as not having a payload, regardless of the response content-length. This fixes an issue that could cause HEAD responses (e.g. s3's headObject responses) with a content-length specified from being treated as having a payload. This fixes issues like [#1216](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/1216) where the SDK attempts to read data from the response based on the content-length, not based on whether there was actually a payload."
