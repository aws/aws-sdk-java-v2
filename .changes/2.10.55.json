            "description": "This SDK release introduces APIs that automate the export of Amazon RDS snapshot data to Amazon S3. The new APIs include: StartExportTask, CancelExportTask, DescribeExportTasks. These APIs automate the extraction of data from an RDS snapshot and export it to an Amazon S3 bucket. The data is stored in a compressed, consistent, and query-able format. After the data is exported, you can query it directly using tools such as Amazon Athena or Redshift Spectrum. You can also consume the data as part of a data lake solution. If you archive the data in S3 Infrequent Access or Glacier, you can reduce long term data storage costs by applying data lifecycle policies."
