    "description": "Amazon EC2 Instance Connect is a simple and secure way to connect to your instances using Secure Shell (SSH). With EC2 Instance Connect, you can control SSH access to your instances using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies as well as audit connection requests with AWS CloudTrail events. In addition, you can leverage your existing SSH keys or further enhance your security posture by generating one-time use SSH keys each time an authorized user connects."
