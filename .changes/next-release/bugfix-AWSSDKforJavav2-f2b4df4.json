    "description": "Add support for payload signing of async streaming requests signed with SigV4 using default `AwsV4HttpSigner` (using `AwsV4HttpSigner.create()`). Note, requests using the `http` URI scheme will not be signed regardless of the value of `AwsV4FamilyHttpSigner.PAYLOAD_SIGNING_ENABLED` to remain consistent with existing behavior. This may change in a future release."
