    "description": "Adds support for tracking feature usage in a new user agent metadata section and adds a base set of features. Where features were already a part of the user agent string, they are now converted to the new format where a feature is represented as a Base64 encoded string, listed in BusinessMetricsFeatureId. For example, using DynamoDb Enhanced Client was previously recorded as 'hll/ddb-enh' in the user agent, but is now a 'd' in the business metrics metadata section 'm/'."
