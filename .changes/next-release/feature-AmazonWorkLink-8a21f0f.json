Amazon WorkLink is a fully managed, cloud-based service that enables secure, one-click access to internal websites and web apps from mobile phones. With Amazon WorkLink, employees can access internal websites as seamlessly as they access any other website. IT administrators can manage users, devices, and domains by enforcing their own security and access policies via the AWS Console or the AWS SDK."
