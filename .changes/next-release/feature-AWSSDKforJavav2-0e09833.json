    "description": "Add new AsyncResponseTransformer: toPublisher(). This transformer makes it more convenient for users to directly consume a streaming-response payload (i.e., S3 GetObject) with async clients. This also allows users of Reactor/RxJava to more easily consume a streaming response (e.g., via Flux#from(Publisher))."
