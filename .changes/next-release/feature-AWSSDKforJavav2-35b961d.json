    "description": "Implement ADAPTIVE retry mode. ADAPTIVE mode builds on STANDARD retry mode and adds rate limiting of requests when the client is throttled.\n\nAdaptive retry mode dynamically limits the rate of AWS requests to maximize success rate. This may be at the expense of request latency. Adaptive retry mode is not recommended when predictable latency is important.\n\nWarning: Adaptive retry mode assumes that the client is working against a single resource (e.g. one DynamoDB Table or one S3 Bucket). If you use a single client for multiple resources, throttling or outages associated with one resource will result in increased latency and failures when accessing all other resources via the same client. When using adaptive retry mode, we recommend using a single client per resource."
