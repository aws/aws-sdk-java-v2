    "description": "This release updates internal logic for constructing API endpoints. \n\nWe have added rule-based endpoint providers. Additionally there are new interfaces for endpoint providers and parameters at the service client level.\n\nThe SDK provides service-specific `EndpointProvider` interfaces (e.g. `S3EndpointProvider`), that have a single method `resolveEndpoint`. `resolveEndpoint` accepts a set of parameters (also service specific) and computes an endpoint based on those parameters. All clients have a default implementation, but users are free to implement these to customize their endpoint logic.\n\nThere may be some behavior changes related to endpoint resolution as as the the endpoint resolution is now standardised across SDKs so this release also bumps the minor version of the SDK to `2.18`."
