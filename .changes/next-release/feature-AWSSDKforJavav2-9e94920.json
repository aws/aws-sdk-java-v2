    "description": "Moved Jackson from being an external SDK dependency to an internal dependency.\n\nCustomers will see a change in artifact sizes. Customers which do not use Jackson-databind outside of the SDK today will see a ~1 MB artifact size decrease. Customers which do use Jackson-databind outside of the SDK will see a ~0.5 MB artifact size increase.\n\nThis change required breaking inter-module (protected) APIs, so customers will not be able to use older client versions with this version of the core libraries. Customers that have previously added Jackson classes to their module path may need to remove them if Jackson is no longer a runtime dependency of their application."
