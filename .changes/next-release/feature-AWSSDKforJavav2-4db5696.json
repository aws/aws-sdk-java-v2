    "description": "Refactor signer interfaces to be independent from Amazon/AWS specific classes. Signer interfaces expose a sign method that takes in the request to sign and ExecutionAttributes instance. Parameters needed for signing are to be passed through ExecutionAttributes. SDK signer implementations have overloaded sign methods that can take either generic ExecutionAttributes or modeled params classes as convenience for customers."
