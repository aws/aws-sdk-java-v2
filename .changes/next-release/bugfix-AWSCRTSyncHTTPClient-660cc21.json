    "description": "Fixed an issue where `CancellationException` was thrown incorrectly from AWS CRT Sync HTTP client when execution time exceeded the total configured API call attempt timeout or API call timeout. Now it throws `ApiCallAttemptTimeoutException`/`ApiCallTimeoutException` accordingly. See [#4820](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/4820)"
