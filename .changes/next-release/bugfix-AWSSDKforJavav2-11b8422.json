    "description": "Use the last seen HTTP/1.1 header value for headers defined to only appear once in an HTTP message instead of merging them all into a list. The order in which header values are inspected is: headers set by the request marshaller, overridden headers set on the client, then finally overridden headers set on the SDK request object. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4.2 for more information."
