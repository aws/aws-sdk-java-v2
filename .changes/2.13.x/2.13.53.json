Certain AI services (Amazon CodeGuru Profiler, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Textract, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Translate), may use content to improve the service. Customers have been able to opt out of this use by contacting AWS Support, and now they can opt out on a self-service basis by setting an Organizations policy for all or an individual AI service as listed above. Please refer to the technical documentation for more details."
