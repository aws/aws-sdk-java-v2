AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, API Gateway, CloudFront, or the Application Load Balancer responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.</p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF features and an overview of how to use AWS WAF, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/\">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#waf_region\">AWS Service Endpoints for AWS WAF</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list.

This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can define a Web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or Web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits AWS WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>"
