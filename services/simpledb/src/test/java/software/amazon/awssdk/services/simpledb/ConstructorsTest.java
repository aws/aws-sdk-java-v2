/**
 * Tests that constructors provided by the SimpleDB model classes are available. This test is
 * primarily intended to help us ensure we aren't making backwards incompatible changes. We aren't
 * testing any specific behavior in the constructors, just that the constructors we expect to exist
 * are available. Backwards incompatible changes would show up as compilation errors, but it's still
 * convenient to model this a test class.
 * <p>
 * A more automated solution for detecting backwards incompatible changes would be a lot better,
 * especially considering all the service models we don't own.
