If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your IAM role provides access to paths in <code>Target</code>. The following is an example.</p> <p> <code>'[ \"/bucket2/documentation\", { \"Entry\": \"your-personal-report.pdf\", \"Target\": \"/bucket3/customized-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf\" } ]'</code> </p> <p>In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope-down policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory (\"<code>chroot</code>\"). To do this, you can set <code>Entry</code> to '/' and set <code>Target</code> to the HomeDirectory parameter value.</p> <note> <p>If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0-byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the AWS CLI, use the <code>s3api</code> or <code>efsapi</code> call instead of <code>s3</code> <code>efs</code> so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: <code>aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/</code>. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a folder.</p> </note>"
