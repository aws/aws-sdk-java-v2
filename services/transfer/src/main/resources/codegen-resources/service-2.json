As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 api to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory.

With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.</p>"
