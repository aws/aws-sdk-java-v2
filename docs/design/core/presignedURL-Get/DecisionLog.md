# S3 Pre-signed URL GET - Decision Log

## Review Meeting: 06/17/2024
**Attendees**: Alban, John, Zoe, Dongie, Bole, Ran, Saranya

### Closed Decisions

1. Create a new PresignedUrlGetObjectResponse specifically for pre-signed URLs, or use the existing GetObjectResponse? Decided to use the existing GetObjectResponse for pre-signed URL operations as the HTTP response from a pre-signed URL GET is same as a standard S3 GetObject response.

2. Use the existing SDK and S3 exceptions or implement specialized exceptions for validation errors like expired URLs? Decided to utilize existing SDK exceptions rather than creating specialized ones for pre-signed URL operations.

3. Provide additional client-side validation with server-side validation as fallback or just rely entirely on server-side validation from S3? No additional client-side validation will be implemented for pre-signed URLs.

### Discussions Addressed

1. Are there alternative methods to skip signing, such as using NoOpSigner(), instead of setting additional Execution attributes? Added the use of NoOpSigner() in the design doc.

2. Does the S3 response include a checksum? If so, should checksum-related support be implemented in this project, or deferred until after Transfer Manager support is added? S3 Response doesn't include checksum.

3. What should we name the Helper API? Options include PresignedURLManager or PresignedUrlExtension. Will be addressed in the Surface API Review.

### Decisions Addressed

1. Should PresignedUrlGetObjectRequest extend S3Request/SdkRequest? Decided to use a standalone request class with minimal parameters (presignedUrl, rangeStart, rangeEnd) to avoid exposing incompatible configurations like credentials and signers. Internally convert to S3Request for ClientHandler compatibility.

2. Replace IS_DISCOVERED_ENDPOINT execution attribute with a more semantically appropriate solution. Decided to introduce new SKIP_ENDPOINT_RESOLUTION execution attribute specifically for presigned URL scenarios where endpoint resolution should be bypassed, as IS_DISCOVERED_ENDPOINT is tied to deprecated endpoint discovery feature.

3. Use separate rangeStart/rangeEnd fields vs single range string parameter. Decided to use separate rangeStart and rangeEnd Long fields for better user experience, as start/end is more intuitive than string parsing.
